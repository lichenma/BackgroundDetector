# BackgroundDetector

Application developed to detect whether the app is currently in the user foreground or background - designed in Android Studio using Kotlin. The project was used to develop my knowledge of android concepts including dependency injection using `Dagger` and other android features such as ProcessLifecycleOwner


## Getting Started

This application was originally designed to be run using Android studio - it is possible to see the application in action by cloning the repository and running the application on Android studio 

```
Run -> Run 'app'
```

### Prerequisites

Ideally the most recent java and gradle versions, I used the following when building and testing the application.

```
Gradle 5.2.1  Java version 1.8.0_192
```

## Built With

* [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) - Android Integrated Development Environment 
* [Gradle](https://gradle.org/) - Dependency Management
